2)	This question required to set different R0 values for a given time interval. Figures 1 & 2 represent the S, E, I, R curves and the incent cases for scenario 1. Figures 3 & 4 represent the S, E, I, R curves and the incent cases for scenario 2. Figures 5 & 6 represent the S, E, I, R curves and the incent cases for scenario 3.<br>

3)	This question had us first download and read the data from BCCDC. We had to plot a scatterplot of the incident cases in BC. We then had to adjust the parameters and initial conditions to make the model look like the scatterplot. The first thing I changed the initial conditions of I(1) and set it to 1, and E(1) and set it equal to 5 * I(1). I then created 10 different intervals all with different R0 values being:
Interval	R0
2-55	3
56-166	0.8
167-215	1.5
216-237	1.4
238-289	1.7
290-367	0.9
368-433	1.259
434-480	0.72
481-520	0.46
520-546	1.6

The plot of the data and model are shown below. <br>
